# raspberrypi-hubot_cluster
An attempt to build a hubot cluster out of seven RaspberryPi ModelB's
## Description
I had some makerbeam and an older Raspberry Pi Cluster with some spare boards.  Not knowing what to do with it I decided see if I could migrate a hubot I had built on Windows Containers, to Linux Containers running across an Older Raspberry Pi Platform.  That being said, the goal of this respository is contain all the code to deploy and manage the stack of bits.
## Ansible
## Containers
### IRCD
* ircd-Hybrid

### Redis

### Hubot
* npm-hubot
